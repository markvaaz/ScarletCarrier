## How It Works

When you summon a carrier, your personal servant appears and can store items in its inventory. The carrier will remain active until you manually dismiss it or use emote controls. All items are automatically saved and will be restored when you summon your carrier again.

**Note:** Instanced items (items with unique properties like enchantments or durability) cannot be stored in the carrier for now. I'll be adding a system to handle these items in the future. *(Maybe)*

## Commands

* `.carrier call` - Summons your carrier servant
* `.carrier dismiss` - Dismisses your carrier early
* `.carrier follow` - Makes your carrier follow you around
* `.carrier stop` - Makes your carrier stay in place
* `.carrier list` - Lists all available carrier appearances

### Emote Controls

For quick and intuitive carrier management, you can use these emotes:

* üëç **Yes** - Summon your carrier
* üëé **No** - Dismiss your carrier
* üëâ **Point** - Toggle between follow/stay behavior

### Appearance System

Your carrier's appearance can be customized using various predefined options. Each player can have their own unique appearance setting that persists between summons. Use `.carrier list` to see all available appearances with their corresponding numbers, then use `.carrier <number>` to apply your preferred look.
