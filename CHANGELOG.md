- **Smart Lifetime System**: Carriers now have a 15-day lifetime that only counts when the server is online
  - Timer resets every time you interact with the carrier (summon, dismiss, or use)
  - Carrier is only destroyed if no interaction occurs for 15 days of server uptime
  - Lifetime duration is configurable in mod settings
- **Enhanced Animation System**: Faster and more fluid spawn/despawn animations

  - `.carrier forcedismiss <playername>` / `.car fd <playername>` - Allows admins to dismiss a specific player's carrier by name
